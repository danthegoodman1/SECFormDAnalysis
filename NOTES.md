# Take 2 observations

Venture Capital is quickly taking over control of acquisition compared to other entities, most notably in the last 4 years

Their investment are becoming more frequent, but round sizes are becoming smaller, meaning that they are either looking earlier stage or smaller companies.

For VCs, their p99 rounds have stayed linear, while everything below has dropped.

Their p50 and below rounds took a sharp dive starting in 2019

Hedge fund share of investments is falling fast

Number of filings used to be heavily weighted to the first quarter

in 2021 and more so in 2022 investments per quarter are rapidly rising

As a whole, the industry is spending less on equity sales

Almost half of all form D filings happened in or after 2017

A dramatic increase of companies have been bootstrapped exiting or raising their first round since 2021

Offerings have come way down in 2022, but filings are way up because there was a long-tail of filings from 2021 offerings. This makes sense as 2021 was a great time to invest, and we saw a lot of activity. With the new interest rates and economy it makes sense that 2022 would be a downturn.
